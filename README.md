# Donation Campaign (Assignment-8)


1. Dynamic Nested Routing with Detailed Views
The application employs React Router to create a seamless navigation experience with nested routes. Users can navigate between "Home," "Donation," and "Statistics" pages easily. Each donation card, categorized under Food, Clothing, Health, and Education, directs users to a detailed view when clicked. This detailed view provides comprehensive information including title, description, donation amount, and a donation button.

2. Interactive and Persistent Donation Management
Utilizing local storage, the application ensures that donation data persists across sessions. Users can donate to various causes, and their donations are saved and displayed on the Donation page. Initially, only four donation cards are shown for a cleaner interface, but users can reveal all their donations by clicking the "See All" button. When users click the "Donate" button, a sweet toast notification confirms the successful donation before saving the data, enhancing user feedback and experience.

3. Real-time Statistics with Visualization
The Statistics page features an interactive pie chart that visually represents the distribution of donations. It compares the user's donations with those of others, showing the data in percentages. This feature provides an insightful overview of donation patterns and encourages users to contribute more by showing their impact.
